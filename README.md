1. Created a table called `online_sales` with order data (date, amount, product).
2. Inserted 50+ rows of realistic monthly sales data.
3. Used MySQL to analyze monthly revenue and order count.
4. Grouped data by year and month using `GROUP BY`.
5. Calculated total revenue with `SUM(amount)` and total orders with `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)`.
6. Found the top 3 months by sales using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`.
7. Saved all queries in `sales_trend_analysis.sql` and added this `README.md` file.
